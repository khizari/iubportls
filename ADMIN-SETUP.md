# Product Admin Panel — Setup Guide

Your site now has a password-protected admin panel at **`/admin`** for
managing products (name, category, price, discounts, stock, and photos)
without touching any code. Changes made in the panel go live on the site
immediately after you click **Save Changes** — no redeploy needed.

## How it works

- `/admin/login.html` — login screen
- `/admin/index.html` — the product editor
- `/api/*` — small serverless functions (already included, run automatically
  on Vercel) that handle login and reading/writing product data
- Product data is stored in **Vercel Blob** storage, so edits persist across
  deployments. Photos you upload in the panel are also stored there.
- If Blob storage isn't set up yet, or nothing has been saved yet, the site
  falls back to the products bundled in `data/products-data.json` (the
  16 products the theme ships with today), so the public site never breaks.
- The homepage ("Product Overview") and the `product.html` shop page both
  pull from the same product list, so you only manage products in one
  place.

## One-time setup on Vercel

### 1. Add environment variables
In your Vercel project → **Settings → Environment Variables**, add:

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | the login username you want, e.g. `admin` |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | a strong password |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | any long random string (e.g. generate one at randomkeygen.com) — this signs the login session, keep it secret |

Apply them to the **Production** environment (and Preview if you want admin
access on preview deployments too).

### 2. Add Vercel Blob storage
1. In your Vercel project, go to the **Storage** tab.
2. Click **Create Database → Blob**.
3. Connect it to this project.

Vercel automatically adds the required token to your project — no extra
env var needed on your end.

### 3. Redeploy
Trigger a new deployment (push a commit, or click **Redeploy** in Vercel) so
the new environment variables and the `/api` and `/admin` folders take
effect.

## Using the panel

1. Go to `https://yourdomain.com/admin` (or `/admin/login.html`).
2. Log in with the username/password you set above.
3. Use **+ Add Product** to add a new item, or edit any existing card's
   name, category, price, and stock directly in the fields.
4. Click **Change Photo** on any product to upload a new photo — it's
   resized automatically so uploads stay small and fast.
5. Toggle **Apply a discount** to show a crossed-out old price next to the
   current price on the storefront.
6. Set **Stock** to `0` to automatically show an "Out of Stock" badge on
   the product photo on the live site.
7. Use the category dropdown at the top to filter which products you're
   looking at while editing (Women / Men / Bag / Shoes / Watches).
8. Click **Delete** on a product card to remove it.
9. Click **Save Changes** at the top. The public site updates right away.

## Notes & limits

- Sessions last 12 hours, then you'll need to log in again.
- Login attempts are throttled (max ~8 tries per 10 minutes per warm
  server instance) to slow down password guessing — this is a speed bump,
  not a hard limit, since Vercel Functions are stateless across instances.
  For stronger protection, put the site behind a WAF/rate limiter at the
  edge.
- Photo uploads are capped at a few MB after automatic compression — plenty
  for product photos.
- Only one admin account is supported (shared username/password). If you
  need multiple staff logins later, that's a bigger change — just ask.
- Consider changing `ADMIN_PASSWORD` periodically, especially if staff turn
  over.
- The `product-detail.html` page is still the theme's original static
  template and isn't wired to per-product data yet — clicking any product
  takes you to the same generic detail page. Say the word if you'd like
  that made dynamic too (so each product links to its own detail page).
